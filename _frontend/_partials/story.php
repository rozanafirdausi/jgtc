							LET’S JAZZ IT UP! The 41st Jazz Goes To Campus will return with the theme: “Bring the Jazz On!”. We aim to make the The 41st Jazz Goes To Campus jazzier than ever, we aim to showcase the different sub-genres of Jazz or even explore a new sub-genre and trigger an understanding that Jazz is still a genre that people celebrate and cherish the most, and Jazz that can be fused with all other genres. The festival itself will host more than 35 local and international musicians on four stages, welcoming more than 20,000 visitors from noon to midnight. Jazz Goes To Campus will continue its commitment as a platform to further develop the Indonesian jazz scenery. In the past few years, the festival has seen incredible performances from globally-known acts including Al Mckay’s Earth Wind & Fire Experience, Dave Koz, Claire Martin Quintet, Bob James, Daniel Powter, Lenka, and Depapepe. Indonesia's most exciting musical acts have also performed at the festival including Maliq & D’Essentials, Tulus, RAN, Indra Lesmana, Eva Celia, The Groove, Chaseiro, Rendy Pandugo, Glenn Fredly, Raisa, and Tompi. The 41st Jazz Goes To Campus is returning on 02 December 2018.
